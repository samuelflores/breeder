This is a stable commit. Recently I have made a lot of changes. The accessors which fetch PDB file names are now explicitly named to clarify whether they fetch PDB numbered or renumbered structures. 
As part of this, the database also stores alternate PDB structures for both renumbered and pdb numbered structures.
Many methods which were implemented more than once are now abstracted to point to a single implementation.
The code now send an email when each leaf (homolog) job is done, or when it is discovered that the job has been done previously and is available for viewing.
